# Module 05 - Lessons Learned, Agent Futures, Q&A

[< Multi-Agent Orchestration](./Module-04.md) - **[Home](Home.md)**

## Introduction

In this Module we will wrap up what you have learned during this workshop. We will also share with you the learnings we gained in bulding a multi-agent system using two of the most popular agent frameworks in use today. We will also share some best practices we developed as we built this workshop and share some of the differences you will encounter as you work with each agent framework with a comparision of each side-by-side to help you choose one that best suits your needs. We will also share where we see both of these frameworks heading in their development and as an industry as a whole. Finally, we will also open things up for a Q&A and provide any latest references for future materials to help you in your journey to create these types of systems.

## Learning Objectives

- Learn what we learned creating this workshop
- Understand the differences between Semantic Kernel Agent Framework and LangGraph
- Learn best practices in building these systems
- Learn where the development of these frameworks is heading and what you can expect.
